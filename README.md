# PriorityAnnouncement
A simple and lightweight priority announcement script for any FiveM server. 

This script was made to help servers get across what kind of priority is going on within their server. Like a vehicle pursuit, or even a bank
robbery! This script helps you get the message across for everybody. 

# Update 1.2.1:
- Update Server. Lua
- - Server.lua argument length check.
- Client.Lua
- - No Updates

# Known Bugs:
2 known bugs: 
MySQL Async will not call properly (High priority)

Version Checker doesn't start on script start (lowest priority)

# Permissions
The ace perms for this resource is fw.psit, so if you restrict certain things to supervisors, it would look somehting like this:

add_ace group.supervisors "fw.psit" allow

Discord ace perms is highly recommended for the ace perms mechanic, although not required at all.
